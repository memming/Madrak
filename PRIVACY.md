# Privacy Policy for Madrak Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** September 2025

## What We Collect and How We Use It

Madrak automatically scrobbles music from YouTube Music to your Last.fm account. We collect only the music metadata (song title, artist, album, duration, play status) from YouTube Music pages and your Last.fm authentication session data. This information is used solely to submit your listening history to Last.fm's official API. All data is stored locally in your browser and is not shared with any third parties except Last.fm.

## Data Sharing

We only share your music listening data with Last.fm (Audioscrobbler Ltd.) through their official API (ws.audioscrobbler.com) to update your listening history. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any other third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.

## Your Rights

- **Control your data:** Disable the extension, clear all data, or revoke Last.fm access at any time
- **No personal information collected:** We don't collect names, emails, or any personal details
- **Local storage only:** All data stays in your browser until you delete it
- **Transparent sharing:** Only Last.fm receives your music data for scrobbling purposes
