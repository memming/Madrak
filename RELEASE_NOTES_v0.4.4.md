# Madrak v0.4.4 Release Notes

## 🎉 Patch Release: Track Detection Improvements

**Release Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Version**: 0.4.4  
**Type**: Patch Release (Bug Fixes & Improvements)

---

## 🚀 What's New

### Track Replay and Completion Detection

This release significantly improves how the extension detects track replays and looping, ensuring that users can properly scrobble the same track multiple times.

#### Key Improvements:

1. **✨ Paused State Replay Detection**
   - Track replays are now detected even when paused
   - Users can seek backwards while paused and it will be properly recognized
   - Eliminates missed scrobbles from paused state operations

2. **🔄 Track Completion and Restart Detection**
   - New logic detects when a track finishes and automatically restarts
   - Properly handles track loops and repeat mode
   - Uses 5-second buffer zones for reliable detection

3. **🎵 Repeated Scrobbles Enabled**
   - Same track can now be scrobbled multiple times when replayed
   - Scrobble flag resets when track ends
   - Fixes the issue where repeated tracks weren't being scrobbled

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Issues

- **Track Replay Not Detected When Paused**: Removed the `isPlaying` requirement for backward time jump detection, allowing replays to be detected regardless of play state

- **Missed Scrobbles on Track Loops**: Added specific logic to detect when a track completes (within 5s of end) and restarts (within 5s of beginning)

- **Repeated Tracks Not Scrobbling**: Reset the scrobble flag when track ends, enabling the same track to be scrobbled on subsequent plays

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Code Changes

**File**: `src/content/youtube-music.ts`

**Methods Modified**:
- `hasTrackChanged()`: Enhanced with paused state handling and completion detection
- `handleTrackEnded()`: Added scrobble flag reset

**Lines Changed**: ~27 lines added/modified

### Detection Logic

```typescript
// Backward time jump detection (paused or playing)
if (this.currentTrack.currentTime > newTrack.currentTime + 5) {
  return true; // Track replayed
}

// Track completion and restart detection
if (this.currentTrack.duration > 0 && 
    this.currentTrack.currentTime >= this.currentTrack.duration - 5 &&
    newTrack.currentTime < 5) {
  return true; // Track completed and restarted
}
```

### Buffer Zones

- **5-second threshold** for backward time jumps (prevents false positives)
- **5-second buffer** at track end (within last 5 seconds)
- **5-second buffer** at track start (within first 5 seconds)

These buffers account for:
- Network lag
- Timing inaccuracies in YouTube Music
- Minor fluctuations during playback

## 📊 Testing

### Automated Tests ✅

- [x] TypeScript compilation: No errors
- [x] Linting: No issues
- [x] Build process: Successful
- [x] Version consistency: All files updated

### Manual Testing Recommended

See `TESTING_PLAN_TRACK_DETECTION.md` for detailed test scenarios:

1. **Track Replay Detection**: Seek backwards and verify detection
2. **Track Completion**: Let track finish and observe restart
3. **Paused State Replay**: Seek while paused and resume
4. **Repeated Scrobbles**: Verify same track can be scrobbled multiple times

## 📈 Impact

### User Experience

**Before v0.4.4**:
- ❌ Replaying tracks didn't always get detected
- ❌ Same track couldn't be scrobbled multiple times
- ❌ Seeking while paused caused issues

**After v0.4.4**:
- ✅ All track replays properly detected
- ✅ Same track can be scrobbled repeatedly
- ✅ Paused state operations work correctly

### Performance

- **Negligible impact**: Only 2-3 simple comparisons added
- **No new DOM queries**: Uses existing track data
- **No memory leaks**: Proper cleanup maintained

---

## 🔄 Upgrade Path

### From v0.4.3 to v0.4.4

**No action required** - Fully backward compatible:
- No storage format changes
- No API changes
- No permission changes
- Existing settings preserved

Simply update the extension and it will work immediately.
